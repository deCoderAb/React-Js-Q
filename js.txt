Server url + api endpoint = rest api 

28+44+40+25

Notes:-
console.loh("hfghgghjjhh)

1) Inside return :- JSX and   <Components/> only.
Variable assigning and functions and States all this thing should be written before return.

2) States:-
	import useState in App.js,
Destructure inside function but before return. useState can only be used in functional components.
State is private property of this component

For definining state in class components we need to use constructor 
Constructor (){
    Super();
    this.state = {   
        name:"Aniket"
     }
  }

render(){
	return( the jsx part )
}

For updating data use arrow function in jsx {()=>this.setState({name:"Bhadke"})}

fName(){
	this.setState({name:'Bhadke'})
}
[in class component :- onClick={()=>this.fName()}      ]

3) by using super keyword we can directly access all content and methods of extends class or 
inherited class.

3) Props:- Props can be used to communicate between the components. We can send data from one component 
to another using props.

	class component   <User count={this.state.count} />
	function component  <User count={count} />

        In functional components access props in function bracket. (props)
	In class components access props in jsx, {this.props.propName}

Props can only be changed in Parent components from where it's been sent.
We can't change it in child component.

4) whenever use map in JSX try to send all html in single tag. Try not to use curly brackets.

5) useState:- this hook is use to define component state.

6) useEffect:- this hook helps us to perform component lifecycle methods. 
useEffect (() => {
   ), [ ]  }   Act like mounting phase.
	This will call once, without dependency array it will call on every update.
	We can use multiple useEffect in single component.

7) dependancy array:- it is use to trigger the change between state and based on that 
we can rerender the component.
useEffect (() => {
   ), [ count ] }   Act like updating phase.

8) useEffect (( ) => {
     return ( ) => {
         Act like unmounting phase.
         Clean up code is here.
     }
   ), [ count ] }
   This will stop all the calls and continues process.

9) useNavigate:- this hook is use to Navigate internally.

5) pureComponent :- only used in class components. In pure component render method calls only, 
when their is something updated if previous state and current state both are same 
then render method doesn't call. so in that way it prevents unnecesary re-rendering.
it works with both state and props.

normal component :- class App extends React.Component(){}  this will rerender no matter state is same.
pure compo :- class App extends React.PureComponent(){}   this will not rerender if the state is same.

6) useMemo:- only used in functional components. So basically we use useMemo and pureComponent 
for preventing unnecesary function calls.
const multiCountMemo = useMemo(() => {
	console.log("multicount")
	return count * 5;
},[count])

it means useMemo will call the function only when the count is updated.

7) createRef:- (class components) using createRef we can access dom elements. 
inside constructor create object to updating state. 
For using createRef inside constructor :-  this.varName=createRef()

	(Ref:- they are use to manage focuse, text selection and media playback.)

8) useRef:- let varName = useRef ()
function abc( ){varName.current.value="1000"}

jsx part :- <input type="text" ref={varName} />
		<button OnClick={abc}> click </button>

*)what is useRef
useRef is a react hook, it is commonly use for accessing dom
elements. we can access element like input using ref attribute
and manege its focus, or color and other things of that 
element. 
and it is very similar to state.
in that we can store the previous value and it will persist
between the render, it will not cause a rerender like 
state does.

so ref are very usefull not only for accesing dom element 
but they are very usefull in persisting value without 
causing a rerender.


9) why use Link and not anchor tag:- because anchor tags reload page but Link never reload the page 
that's why we should use Link tags 

*) constructor is also life cycle method which calls first.

10) componentDidMount :- this is the method we use in 1st phase of component lifecycle.  
It calls just after render method calls, 
means when our constructor and states are ready and jsx is ready. then only this method will call. 

we can call api here because when this method will call, our html would have been allready ready.

11) return will execute the html element but that element need to be defined in jsx extension.
 
12) componentDidUpdate:- this is the method we use in 2nd phase of component lifecycle. 
It calls after something gets update in component. Like state or Props.

their is anothor method call shouldComponentUpdate 
we can set a condition on componentDidUpdate using shouldComponentUpdate. we have to set it false.

13) componentWillUnmount:- this is the method we use in 3rd phase of component lifecycle. 
so when we want to remove our component then we use this method.
this method will call just before we close the component. 
so we can unsubscribe all async calls in this method. in that way we can 
avoid memory leak from component. 

14) when life cycle method take place in react
:- 	when component is loaded, 
	when component is updated with states or Props and 
	When component is removed.

16) console.log flow
       1) constructor (){}
       2) render(){}
Call every time
       3) return ()
       
       4) componentDidMount(){}
this method calls only when component mount 
(We call api here)

       5) shouldComponentUpdate(){
           If(condition){
             return false/true ; 
             }}
 It can stop rendering
 Means it allows us to render our component on a specific condition (if)
       
       6) componentDidUpdate(pp,ps){}        
this method calls only if something updated in component
       It takes 2 parameters
      
 Previous props & Previous state

	7)componentWillUnmount()

17) React.PureComponent
pureComponent is only used in class components. In pure component render method calls only, 
when their is something updated if previous state and current state both are same 
then render method doesn't call. so in that way it prevents unnecesary re-rendering.
and It helps to increase the applications performance.
it works with both state and props

pureComponent == useMemo,useCallback

18) useMemo ( ( ) => {  }, [  ] )
:- useMemo is a hook, same like a pureComponent, we use it to prevents unnecessary function calls.
     So with the help of useMemo we can specify, when any function should call and when it shouldn't.

19) Controlled component:- (codeStepbystep vid 6.32.30)
	They do not maintain their own state, data is controlled by parent component.
So basically in react
  When we control any dom element (input fields) using state it's called as controlled component. 
	const [val, setVal] = useState('')
  <Input value={val} onChange={(e)=>setVal(e.target.value)}  />
  
20) uncontrolled component:- They do maintain their own state, data is controlled by DOM.
Ref are use to get their currunt value. 
(When we use useRef or creatref it's a uncontrolled component.)

21) Hoc:- HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns an enhanced version. 
We can pass a component as a prop

It's nothing but a techniqe to reuse a logic, and with this we can add it some more functionality
so that our reused component would look slightly different

22) Routing:- Routing we use for navigating throughout the application.
we can open different components on a specific endpoint, so yaa thats what routing is
npm install react-router-dom

23) Redux :-
	Store:- import createStore    const store = createStore(reducerFunction, {}); <<<---------<
	Action:- inside a Function return type in object; and parameter is payload; then export   |   
		export const actionName = () => { type :'ACTION'}                                 |
	reducer:- inside a reducerFunction parameter take initialState and action;                |
		  switch(action.type){case 'ACTION' : return initial state(and extra logic);      |
		  default : return state;                                                         |
			then export function    >>>-------------------------------------------->>>^
		Now in root file (main index.js) import store and
	<Provider store={store}>     (import {Provider} from 'react-redux')
         <App1 /> 
        </Provider>

		Now in the component where we want to use redux state
	import {useSelector,useDispach} from 'react-redux'
	import {actionName}
	const myState = useSelector((state) => state.reducerFunction)
    	const dispatch = useDispatch();

	onClick={() => dispatch(functionCreatedInAction(payload))}
 
			-----------------****React****-----------------

1) What is Reactjs?
	React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library. which is use for creating 
user interface for single page application. 
It was developed by Facebook. and it's current version is 18.2.0

2) why is react so popular? / what are the features of React
 a. Because It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM. and it is considering that Real DOM
    manipulations are expensive, which makes web applications perform faster.
 b. React follows a unidirectional data flow. That means when designing a React app, 
    we can nest child components within parent components. 
    And since the data flows in a single direction, 
    it becomes easier to debug errors and to know where the problem is(occurs) in an application.
 c. also we can re-use components in react.
 d. react is a library and it is easy to learn as compare to framworks like angular.

3) what are states? 
	The state is a built-in React object that is used to store data or information about
the component. The state in a component can be changed over the time, and whenever it changes, 
the component gets re-render.

4) what are props?
	Props are also built-in React object that provide a way to pass data from one component 
to another component.	

5)diffrentiate state and props?
	:- state and props both hold some information but the diffrence between them is 
props can be use to pass data from one component to another component, whereas state can not pass data,
but states can be changed as it is mutable. props are immutable.

6)diffrentiate useMemo and useCallback? (codestepbystep vid 5.58.20)
	this two are hooks that we can use in functional component, useMemo hook return the memoize the value,
basicaly it keeps track of previously computed value. and whenever the dependency of it's 
array changes, insted of recalculating the entire logic it just return the memoize value
					and
	the useCallback hook returns a memoized callback function. think of memoization as
caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.

	so, the main difference between useCallback and useMemo is the type of value they return. 
useCallback returns a memoized callback function, while useMemo returns a memoized value.

	The useMemo() hook is used in functional components to memoize
expensive functions so that they are only called when value of the state changes
rather than on every render.     const result = useMemo(() => expensivesunction(input), [input]);



React.memo => not a hook
React.memo is a higher order component, it prevent rerender of component if its props or state do not changed




7)What is a higher-order component in React?
A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as a argument
and returns a new component.
	A higher-order component acts as a container for other components. 
They are generally used when multiple components need to use a same logic. 
so basicaly higher-order component can pass any 'component' as a props to multiple components.
in that way we dont need to write that common logic again and again we can simply re-use it. 
This helps to keep component simple and enables re-usability.

8) What is refs?
   *********detailed answer needed*********
Ref are an attribute of the DOM elements.
The primary purpose of the refs is to find the DOM elements easily.
It should be avoided in most cases but, sometimes it is used when we need to access DOM.

9) What Does DOM Stand For? (what is dom and virtual dom?)
	The term "DOM" stands for Document Object Model. it refers to the
representation of the entire user interface of a web application as a tree
data structure. it has different node, and element ya thats what dom is.

10) What is Virtual DOM?
	so React keeps a lightweight representation of the
real DOM, and that is known as the virtual DOM.
so when the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes
only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating the
entire DOM. 

so React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM, and that is known as the virtual DOM.
	Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in
Virtual DOM representation. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the
new one is calculated. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only
the things that have actually changed.


11) What is Redux? 
	Redux is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the application state.
Redux uses a single store to store all the states, and we can access that state 
anywhere in any component of the application. it has 3 components

	Store: where we store the state of the application.
	Action: actions are plane javascript object where we have type and payload
		where we discribe what action need to be perform. and
	Reducer: Specifies how the application's state changes in response to 
		actions we've sent to the store.

redux principle:-
1)single source of truth
	The globle state of our application is stored as an object inside a single store.
2)state is read only
	The only way to change the state is to dispach an action.

12) What is Context?
React context provide a way to pass data or state through the component tree
without having to pass props through each nested component.
basicaly when we use context, we don't need to do prop drilling.
It helps us to share data globally between various react components.

  import {createContext} from 'react'; ==> App.js
we need 'Provider' for sending data and

	const FirstName = createContext() [same as we use let ipRef = useRef()]
function ComponentA(){
	return(
	<FirstName.Provider value={'Aniket'}>
		<ComponentB>
	</FirstName.Provider>
)} 
	

we need 'Consumer' for reciving the data, consumer allways take arrow function.

'useContext' is a hook that we use for consume data.
so when we use Consumer for getting data, we have to write a lenghy code, that reduce the
code readability. so that's where the useContext hook comes into the picture.
  
  import {useContext} from 'react';
  import {FirstName} from './App.js';
function ComponentB(){
	const fname = useContext(FirstName)
	return(
		<div>My name is {fname}</div>
	)
}


13)Explain the useEffect() Hook?
	The useEffect Hook allows us to perform side effects in function components.
like data fetching, direct DOM updates, timers like setTimeout().
This hook accepts two arguments: the callback and the dependencies,
which allow us to control, when the side effect should execute.

a)useState? :-

b)useNavigate :- in function Navigate('/');  

c)useRef :-

d)useMemo :- 

e)useCallback :-

f)useContext :- 'useContext' is a hook that we use for consume data. while working with context.

g)useReducer :- 'useReducer' is a hook that is use for state management in React.
		useReducer is related to reducer function. 
		this hook accept two parameter useReducer(reducer,initialState)
		reducer(currentState,action)

14)What is React Router? v6.6.1
	React router is a standard library used in React applications, 
to handle routing and allow us to navigation between various components of the application.

in App.js => import { BrowserRouter as Router,Routes,Route } from 'react-router-dom';

and where we want to use link => import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

	<Router>
            <Header />
            <Routes>
                <Route path='/' element={<ProductList />}></Route>           
                <Route path='/ProductDetails/:id' element={<ProductDetails />}></Route>           
                <Route>404 Page not found</Route>           
            </Routes>
        </Router>

and where we want to use link => import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

	<Link to={`/ProductDetails/${id}`}>
        <div>
            <h3>{item}</h3>
            <p1>{price}</p1>
        </div>
        </Link>

in old version we were using <Switch> insted of <Routes>
	<Switch>
             <Route path='/' exact component = {<ProductList />}></Route>           
             <Route path='/ProductDetails/:id' exact component = {<ProductDetails />}></Route>           
             <Route>404 Page not found</Route>           
        </Switch>


15)What are React Hooks? 
Hooks is a special JavaScript function that allows you use state and
other React features without writing a class.
React hooks were added in v16.8 version of react. 

16) Advantages of React ?
1. It has a shorter learning curve for JavaScript developers and has large
and active community support.
2. react applications are faster than the normal application Because React uses virtual DOM, 
which makes web application perform faster.
3. The use of JSX allows us to write simpler code.

17)Disadvantages of React
1. Because React is just a frontend library, we need other languages and libraries
to build a complete application.

18)use of componentWillUnmount()? (******incompeate answer*******)
when the component is not needed and need to be unmounted from the browser DOM.
we use componentWillUnmount()
It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners 
associated with the component. 


it calls just before the component is unmountened from the DOM, it is also use to 
create memory spaces.

19)what is callback?     (******incompeate answer*******)
callback is a function that we can pass as an argument to another function that is called callback.


21)functional or class which components are better?
functional components are much more better than the class components. because in 
functional components we can write cleaner code, and after the introduction of hooks
we can now perform side effect like components lifecycle in functional component.  


23)middleware?(Thunk)
when we make a async api call in action creator, we need to convert our action creator from synchronous
to asynchonous action creator and this conversion can be possible with the help of middleware.
I've worked with redux thunk to make asynchonous action creator.

synchonous action creator. :- Immediately return the action object with type and payload.
asynchonous action creator. :- Take some amount of time to return the action object with type and payload.

without middleware dispach immediately forword the action object to reducer but
middleware will hold the action creator untill it recive the data from server. once it get the data
then it will send the data to reducer and then reducer will create new state.

in store.js import {applyMiddleware, compose} from 'redux'
const composeEnhancer = gitlink

const store = createStore(){  
	combineReducer,
	composeEnhancer(applyMiddleware(thunk))
}

24) what is jsx?
jsx stands for JavaScript XML. jsx allows us to write HTML look a like code
within our javaScript code, which makes it easier to create the stucture of our user interface.

25)what are events in react?
any action performed by user is known as event, like
mouse click, pressing a button or scrolling the page this kind of actions are events.
events are named using camelCase insted of using lowercase. and then events are 
passed as a function.

26)diff btw react and angular?
a) angular is a framework whereas react is just a liabrary.
b) then angular is the compleate MVC whereas react only work on 'view' layer of MVC.
   using react we can build ui compo only.
c) angular uses the real dom, react uses virtual dom.
d) in angular we have 2 way data binding so we can pass data from parent to child and child to parent
   but in react we have unidirection data flow so we can pass data from parent to child only.
e) angular is created and maintained by google. react is created and maintained by facebook.
 


			-----------------****JavaScript****-----------------
*)ES6 features ?
	1)let and const keywords
	2)Arrow functions
	3)Template literals `My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`
	4)Array and Object Destucturing
	5)Promises
	6)multi-line string using backticks(`)
	7)spread and rest operator
	8)
	9)
	10)
these are some es6 features which are really helpfull while buiding application.

1) diffrentiate between let/const and var?
Both let and var are used for variable declarations in JavaScript.
the difference between these two is var keyword has function scope, 
while let keyword has a block scope.

2)what is scope?
scope means the area of code where we can access the variable or functions.

 Globle scope :- means all the variables and functions having global scope can be accessed 
		 from anywhere inside the code.
			var globalVariable = "Hello world";

 Function scope :- which means that all the variables and functions having function scope 
		can be accessed only within a function in which they are defined. and not outside of it.
		also known as local scope. 

 Block scope :- any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside that block.
		Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. 
		Variables declared with var do not have block scope.
 
 lexical scope :- lexical scope is the ability of a function scope to access variables from the parent 
		scope. means,
		lexical scope allows inner functions to access the scope of their outer functions.

3) Explain Closures in JavaScript?
Closure is one of the most powerfull feature of javascript. it forms around a function along with it's 
lexical scope. that means inner function can access any variable from their outer scope, even after
the outer scope has closed.

closures are basicaly formed whenever a variable that is define outside of the current scope
can be access within the current scope.

closure is one of the most powerfull feature of javascript. using closure inner function is granted
to have access of any variable and function which is defined in it's outer function scope.
but outer function doesn't have accses to the variable and function which is defined in inner function. 
that means Closure is an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions 
that are declared in its outer scope.

benifit if they asked :- it provide a sort of security to data inside inner funtion.

4) What is callback function?
callback is a function that we can pass as an argument to another function that is call callback.

A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets execute
	
means we can use this callback function as parameter of another function.
basicaly callback is a function which will be called in future. i mean later in the time.

function sum(a,b){
	return a + b;
}

function calc(cb,x,y){
	return cb(x,y);
}
console.log(calc(sum,4,5))


5) What is the use of promises in javascript? 
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.

Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. 
But due to the limited functionality of callbacks, using multiple callbacks to handle 
asynchronous code can lead to unmanageable code.

A promise is created using the Promise constructor which takes a callback function 
with two parameters, resolve and reject respectively.

We can consume any promise by attaching .then() and .catch() methods to the consumer.

then() method is used to access the result when the promise is resolved/fulfilled.

catch() method is used to access the result/error when the promise is rejected.


6) What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?
 *Primitive types
Primitive data types can store only a single value. 
Number
String
Boolean
Null - It represents a non-existent or a invalid value.
Undefined - When a variable is defined but not assigned any value.

 *Non-primitive types
non-primitive data types are used to store multiple and complex values. 

Array and Object

*********------------53,54,55 coding questions?------------*********

7) Explain Hoisting in javascript ?
Hoisting is the default mechanism of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top of the scope.

Note - Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted:-

variable declared with let and const are also hoisted but, unlike var, are not initialized with a default value. 
so it will throw an error that the variable cannot access before initialization.

var x;
console.log(x); // Outputs "undefined" since the initialization of "x" is not hoisted
x = 23;
Note - To avoid hoisting, you can run javascript in strict mode by using “use strict” 
on top of the code: "use strict";
x = 23; // Gives an error since 'x' is not declared
var x; 



8)What do you mean by strict mode in javascript?
strict mode as it's name suggest it allow us to write code in a 'strict' environment,

The 'use strict' keyword is used to define strict mode at the start of the script. 
when we use strict mode,
we can not use duplicate arguments.
we can not use the JavaScript keyword as a parameter or function name.
Strict mode is supported by all browsers.

9)what is javascript?
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development.
it allows us to implement dynamic featurs on web pages that cannot be done with only
HTML and CSS.
javascript is a single threaded language. it run on browser as well as on server via node.js

10) Explain “this” keyword.
The “this” keyword refers to the object that is curruntly calling the function.

 var obj = {
    name:  "vivek",
    getName: function(){
    console.log(this.name);
  }     
}

       
var getName = obj.getName;
       
var obj2 = {name:"aniket", getName };
obj2.getName();
Can you guess the output here?

The output will be “aniket”. 

11) What is the difference between Session storage and Local storage?
local storage and session storage both are browser storage.
So Websites store some data in local machine to reduce the loading time;

The data stored in session storage gets deleted when a page session ends.
means when user close the tab the data gets deleted.
(when we close the browser)
so we can store sencetive data here which we want to erase after session.

and The data stored in local storage does not get deleted at the end of a
browsing session.

localStorage.setItem('key','value')
let name =  localStorage.getItem('key')
console.log(name)  //value

12)what is deep copy and shallow copy?
primitive data type is immutable and it allways create deep copy, by default.

deep copy means if you do any change in the copied variable, it will never reflect into 
the original one. because they share different memory address. so in premitive data 
type their is allways deep copy.

shallow copy means if we copy an object into new reference variable, both old and new 
reference variable point to the same object in memory. so if we do any change in the 
copied variable, it will reflect into the original one as well.

there are some methods using this methods we can create deep copy of non-primitive data type.
let originalValue = {
    name:  "vivek",
    age: 26,
    getName: function(){
    console.log(this.name);
    },
	address:{
		city:'pune',
		state:'maharastra'}
     
}
a) JSON.stringify => this method can create deep copy but it can not copy function.
let copiedValue = JSON.parse(JSON.stingify(originalValue))

b) Object.assign => this method can create partial deep copy means if the object is 
		   containing nested object then the change will reflect in original object as well.
let copiedValue = Object.assign({}, originalValue) 
c) spread operator => we can use spread operator to create deep copy.
let copiedValue = {...originalValue}
mutation should be in this way
copiedValue = {...copiedvalue,
		name: 'Aniket',
		address:{...copiedValue.address,
			city:'Amravati' 
			}
		}


13)Array methods (map, filter, reduce)?
const array = [1,2,3,4,5]
    const result = array.map((val)=>{
            return val*2
    })
    console.log(result) // [2,4,6,8,10]

    const result2 = array.filter((val)=>{
        return val>3
    })
    console.log(result2) // [4,5]

    const result3 = array.reduce((val,cval)=>{
        return cval+=val
    },0)
    console.log(result3) // 15

map     := create a new array from calling a function for each and every element.
		og array will not change.
filter  := create a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
		og array will not change.
reduce  := this method does not change the original array. it returns a single value
		which is the function accumulated result.
forEach := forEach method work like map method but it does not return anything, 
		it mutates the original array.
push    := we can add data to the end of an array using push method.
pop     := we can remove the last element from array using pop method.
shift   := we can remove the first element from array using shift method.
unshift := we can add data to the begining of an array using unshift method.

13.1) what is the difference between map and forEach?
	this two methods works quite similarly but difference between them is  
forEach does not return anything, whereas map return new array with new array element.
and map method does not muted the original array but forEach muted the original array.

14)what is async await in javascript?
async and await make promises easier to write.
if we wrote the word 'async' before a function means that function will always return a promise.
and the keyword 'await' makes javascript wait until the promise fullfild and returns its result.

15) Rest parameter and spread operator ?
answer in coding question. 

14) Difference between arrow function and normal function ?
Arrow function has been introduced in ES6. it has diffrent syntax than normal function 
it provides a more concise syntax for writing
function expressions by removing the 'function' keyword.
we can remove 'return' keyword too, if we have only one statement.
and arrow function can not be hoisted.

15)what is API
'Application programing interface'

16)difference between undefine, undeclared and null
undefine means the variable has been declared but the value has not yet been assigned to that variable.
undeclered means that variable is not declared or does not exist in the program.
null is actually an assignment value that we can assign to any variable that means 
that variable contain no value.

17) what is destructuring ?
destructuring is a feature of es6. which allows us to unpack values.
we can use destructuring to extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to the variables. 

18) What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior that occurs with variables declared using let and
const keywords before they are initialized.

19) What are the pop-up boxes available in JavaScript?
Pop-up boxes available in JavaScript are Alert Box, Confirm Box, and Prompt Box.

20)what is higher order function?
Higher order function is a function that accepts functions as parameters and returns its result.
and the argument which we pass in higher order function is become callback function.

function x(fn){
	fn();
}

function y(){
	console.log('i am from fn y')

}

x(y);

		-----------------****HTML & CSS****-----------------

1) what is the diffrence between semantic and non-semantic elements?
 A semantic element clearly describes it's meaning.
 there definition in the code tells the browser and the developer
 what they are supposed to do.
 ex:- header, footer, form, table, article, aside, nav.

 non-semantic elements :- unlike semantic element they dont have any meaning.
 they don't tell about the content inside them.
 ex:- div, span.

2) HTML5 is the latest version we are using.
 if we want to upload a file we have to use input tag with type='file'

3) CSS3 is the current version we are using.

	css syntax ==> selector{property:value}
	class ==> .class-name (we can use multiple classes)
	id ==> #id-name (we can use only one id)

		<h1 class="btn btn-1" id="id-name">Heading-1</h1>

4) how many ways are their to implement css file in html?
	their are 3 ways we can implement css file in html
inline css, internal css, and external css.

inline css :- we can write css inside the html tag which we want to design. style='color:red'

internal css :- when we use css directly in html head using <style> tag then it is internal css.
	<style> h1{color:blue} </style>

external css :- here we create css file, we write css in that file and then we can add that file in html.
	<link> rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='(path)style.css' </link>

5)what is the position attribute?
their are 5 position attribute
static which is default one, second is relative
third is absolute and fourth is fixed and sticky.
 
6)what is the difference between margin and padding?
the space between element and the border which is inner space is known as padding.
and the space between border and the other element is known as margin.  

7) flexbox attribte ?
 justify content is use for align the content horizontly
 align item is use for align item virticaly
and if we write justify content and align item as center (display:flex) 
then we will get our item in the center. 
flex-direction
flex-wrap

8) what is meta tags ?
meta tags are HTML tags to provide additional information about a page to search engines and other 
clients. meta tags are added to the <head> section of HTML page.

9) what are the difference between relative and absolute position.?
this two are basically css positions. 

10)How to center a div?
know the answer

11) difference between relative and absolute position ?
relative position is relative with parent, it changes from their own position to top,left,bottom and right.
while absolute position find their just parent athorwise it is relative to the root element.

position absolute : if parent element has relative position property then absolute child element will 
move according to it's parent element otherwise it will consider root HTML as it's parent and 
will act according. 

position fixed : this position will fix the element on webpage where we will define.
		and it is relative to the root.

position sticky : using this property child element can only move within the parent container.
		child element can't get out of parent container.
	top and left will be considered from top and left of webpage and not from parent container. 
		it is relative to the parent.

12)what is psedo class?
psedo classes are used to add style or effect to selectors like hover effect
h1:hover{color : orange;}
:link
:visited
these are some psedo

13)diff between focus and visible

14)flex

        -----------------##############----------------------

interview taken by Akhilesh
1)HTML entites?
HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in an HTML document. it allows us to use
symbols, charectors and mathematical operators.
each of these codes starts with an ampersand and ends with a semicolom.
ex:- &copy; for copyright,   &lt; for <   ,  &gt; for >

2)Difference between id's and classes?
in HTML, both Id and Class are the element selector and are used to identify an element.
the basic difference between Id and class is that only one id selector can be attached to an element
in a page, because id is uniqe, while the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.

3)Difference between strong and bold tag?
	To bold the text in HTML, we can use either the <strong> tag or the <b> bold tag. browser will
bold the text inside both of these tags the same way, but the <strong> tag indicate that the text
has some importance. as <strong> tag is a sementic tag. but bold tag is not.

4)Difference between display non and visibility hiden?
visibility:hidden => hides the element, but it will still takes space in the layout.
display:none      => will removes the element from the document. so it will not take any space.

5)How to open link in anothor tab?
it is quite easy. all we need to do is add target="_blank" in anchor tag {underscore _ }

6)Difference between sementic element and non-sementic element ?
 i know the answer

7)CSS box model?
the css box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. it consists of the actual content,
padding, borders and margin.

element => padding => border => margin

8)Different type of selectors?
	1)element selector :- we can simply use element name for applying css
	2)id selector
	3)Class selector
	4)universal selector :- that is used to select every element on the entire webpage.
	5)Group selector :- this selector is used to style all comma separated elements with same style.
	6)Attribute selector :- [href]
	7)pseudo class selector :- h1:hover{color : orange;}

9)z index?
z index is a css property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements.
element with the higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.
z index only work with positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative)

10)How to center a div element?
a) .parendiv{position : relative;}
   .childdiv{
	position : absolute;
	left : 50%;
	right : 50%;
	transform : translate(-50%,-50%);
	}

b) .parentdiv{
	display:flex;
	justify-content:center;
	align-items:center;
	}

c) .parentdiv{
	display : grid;
	place-items : center;
	}

11)Difference between == and === ?
== will compare two variables only. if both are same it will give us true output but
=== will compare two variables as well as their data type. 

console.log({a:1}=={a:1})  //false
console.log({a:1}==={a:1}) //false

in JS, Object are compared based on references. so here we are comparing 2 different
objects so their references will be different. thats why false.

12)What are the datatypes in javascript?
know this answer

13)Difference between var,let and const?
	if i use const for array can i change the array?

14)what is immediatly invoking function?
immediatly invok function expresion also known as iife. it is a javascript function that runs
as soon as it is defined. it is also known as self executing function.
	(function test(){console.log('test')})();
  

15)what is lexical scope?
lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.
lexical scope allows inner functions to access the scope of their outer functions.
 
we call the child function to be lexically bound by that of the parent function.

16) what is event capturing and event bubbling?
event capturing :-
	this proccess start with capturing the event of the outermost element and then 
propagate to the innermost element.
event bubbling :-
	this proccess start with capturing the event of the innermost element and then 
propagate to the outermost element.

we can stop this propagation using event.stopPropagation()	
event.stopImmediatePropagation() method will stop all the eventListener of same element.

when it's needed to stop the default behavier of element we use
event.preventDefault()

17)what is arrow function? 
Arrow function has been introduced in ES6. their syntax is different than normal function.  
it provides a more concise syntax for writing 'function expressions' by removing the 'function' keyword.
we can remove 'return' keyword too, if we have only one line of code.

	does arrow function support hoisting => NO
	does let and const support hoisting => Yes,but it goes in temporary dead zone.
Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior that occurs with variables declared using let and
const keywords before they are initialized.

it will throw a ReferenceError : because that variable cannot be accessed befor initialization 

18)10 features of ES6 ?

19)what is promis.all ?
Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an
iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any
one of them gets rejected.

Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => { console.log(result)}
 
20)what is Set and map ?(new datatype)
A set is a data stucture used for storing data of any length and kind. sets are iterables 
and have various special methods that are differnt from arrays. it looks like array but 
their is a differece.
in sets we can not access elements by index, and we can not have diplicate elements.
so sets are the great choice when we want to store data without duplicates.

A map is another data structure used to store key-value pairs of data of any kind and length.
maps are similar to objects, in maps, we can use anything as a key.
but in object we can use string, symboles,and numbers as a key.

21)what is virtual dom ? which dom is faster => both are same ?

22)what is jsx ?

23)can we write react code without jsx ?
import React from 'react';

export default function App() {
	return React.createElement(
	'h1',
	{ className: 'greeting' },
	'Hello, this is a JSX Code!'
	);
	}

24)why do we need key while map ?
keys help react to identify which items have changed, or are added, or removed. 

25)difference between class and functional component ?
	Class Components: These types of components can hold and manage their own
state and have a separate render method to return JSX on the screen. They are also
called Stateful components as they can have a state.
	Functional Components: These types of components have no state of their own and
only contain render methods, and therefore they are also called stateless components.
	class components are Complex as compared to the stateless component as it has complex syntax.
on the other hand function component are very simple and easy to understand.
	class components can work with all lifecycle methods.
	function components can not work with any lifecycle method.

26)what is pureComponent ? How does it prevent re-rendering? (codeStepbyStep vid 5.46.26)
React.PureComponent
pureComponent is only used in class components. In pure component render method calls only, 
when their is something updated if previous state and current state both are same 
then render method doesn't call. so in that way it prevents unnecesary re-rendering.
and It helps to increase the applications performance.
it works with both state and props.


27)Explain lifecycle method ? how to use componentWillUnmount in useEffect? 

28)how to pass data in sibling component? => context and reduct

29)what is lazy loading?
lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources until 
they're actually needed 
to improve the performance and save system resources.

30)what is error boundary? 
Error boundary is React component that catch javaScript errors anywhere in the app,
(child component tree)  log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

A class component become an error boundary by defining either or both
getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle method.

To create an error boundaries, we have to create a class component and define 
a state variable for determining whether the error boundary has cought an error.

class ErrorBound extend React.Component(){
constructor(props){
	super(props)
	this.state={hasError:null}
}

static getDerivedStateFromError(error){
	return {hasError:true}	
}

componentDidCatch(error,info){
	console.log(error)
	console.log(info)
}

render(){
	return(
	<div>{ this.state.hasError ? <h1>Something went Wrong...<h1> : this.props.children }</div>
)
}
}

and we need to import error boundry in app.js and creat a wraper and inside it pass the component(User)
The placement of wrapper is compleatly up to us we can wrap entire app or individual component.

with error bundarary, if there is an error, we can trigger a fallback UI;
whereas, with try...catch, we can catch errors in our code.

suspense is similar to ErrorBoundary, but instead of catching the error, it is
catching Promise from child component.

31)what is memo?


31)what is higher order?

32)difference between forEach and map ?
know its answer

33)Explain call, bind, apply method ? 
using call method we can do function borrowing. we can borrow a function of other object and 
use it with the data of some other object.

let name = {
	fistName : 'Ethan',
	lastName : 'Hunt'
}

let printFullName = function(city, state){
	console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + 'from' + city + ',' + state)}

let name2 = {
	fistName : 'John',
	lastName : 'Wick'
}

so, in call method
the first argument will be reference object and second argument will be parameter of function.
	a call method is used to invoke a function directly.

printFullName.call(name,'NY','USA')  // Ethan Hunt from NY,USA
printFullName.call(name2,'NY','USA')  // John Wick from NY,USA

apply is exactly same as a call method but the only difference is it takes second argument as a 
array list of the parameter which need to be pass to the function.

printFullName.call(name,'NY','USA')  // Ethan Hunt from NY,USA
printFullName.apply(name2,['NY','USA'])  // John Wick from NY,USA

bind method does not directly envoke like call method but gives us a copy of exactly same method
which can be invoke later. 

let printMyName = printFullName.bind(name,'NY','USA')
printMyName(); // Ethan Hunt from NY,USA


34)var z = 10;
var show = function(){
    delete z;
    return z;
}
console.log(show())

delete operator :- delete operator is used to delete the property of an object.
so here 'z' is not an object but its a primitive type, so it will not give any 
error intead simply display value as 10.

35)what is axios?
axios is a npm package that we can use for making http request

36)
37)
38)
39)
40) 

this keyword referes to the current object.

Axios,async await,try catch,get,post methods ==>
const getApiData = async () => {
	try{
	const res = await axios.get('api link/posts');
	setMyData(res.data)
	}
	catch(error){
	setIsError(error.message)
}

useEffect(()=>{
	getApiData();
},[])

in api folder we can create anothor folder (contacts) and inside it

import axios from 'axios'

export default axios.create({
	baseUrl : "https://localhost:3000/"
})

Now you can import api from '...api/contacts'
and use it like axios means (api.get instead of axios.get)


callstack


41)Redux-thunk middleware
inside store 
import {createStore,applyMiddleware,compose} from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';


42)fetch data
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(json => json.map(u=>console.log(u.company.name)))

[{},{}] if we get array of object map the array then console value inside it.
